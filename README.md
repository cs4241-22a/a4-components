## Assignment Tracker v03

http://a4-cole-ouellette.glitch.me

This project was designed with WPI students in mind. It is a one-stop shop where a user can go online and keep track of every course and assignment that they have underway at any given time and add additional ones at any time. v03 of this assignment is a front-end revamp of A2 and does not include the user authentication added in A3. The React components utilized in this assignment made populating tables from the forms incredibly easy once I got a handle on how .jsx files work. React was different to use at first, but quickly grew on me and I will definitely exploring it further in the future.
