## Bookshelf

I made my assignment two into a React web app. I used React to create a virtural bookshelf where users can add books to the table and keep track of how many pages they have read and how many pages are left in their book. They can edit books on their shelf to keep tracking their books. They can also delete books if they finish them. Personally, React was easier to implement than the original assignment two as there was so much resouces, tutorials and documentation. I believe it improved the development experience.
