This webpage allows a user to manage a list of groceries. A user can add, remove completed, and remove all items. 

This is a React app that uses an express server suported by snowpack.

I used a CSS stylesheet that controls the colors and spacing between html elements. The font I chose is DM Sans from GOogle Fonts.
