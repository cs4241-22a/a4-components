## A4 - Secure Todo List w/ React!

heroku link:

Login and create a Todo list. Todo page is now written with react components, using stuff like the map function, props, useState & useEffect hooks.

middleware used:
lazydebug, a middleware function I wrote that console logs whereever you call it. (I got rid of it b/c the console logs were getting annoying. It is on my a3 project. )
argon2, for hashing passwords
mongoose, for connecting with the mongoDB server easier
expressRouter, for more routing options
ejs view engine for some server side rendering

CSS Template: Bootstrap

## Technical Achievements

- **Hosting on Heroku**: If you can get to the site from the url, it works
- **100% Lighthouse Test**: All pages score 100% on google lighthouse in the 4 categories

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**:
  CRAP Principles:
  contrast - light background with dark and legible text, bright buttons
  repetition - forms are as similar as possible, with predictable placement of inputs and buttons.
  Alignment - did center placement for most items, left aligned the create todo form because it was a bit bigger
  Proximity - Form elements were closer to each other than to other elements, made sure elements had space (margin, padding) and weren't crowded, and were grouped when they belonged together
