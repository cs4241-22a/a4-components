## Custom pokemon v3
This application allows users to create a pokemon by giving it a name, description, and types. The server then generates the pokemon's weaknesses, resistances, and immunities and returns all of the user's pokemon in a table. The only major change from v2 (assignment 3) was the removal of the button that showed how to use the app, since the CSS framework did not fully support react and I did not want to try to find a workaround. 

The use of React improved the development experience. It made it much easier to implement the frontend, and it also made the frontend more readable. If I were to make further improvements, I would attempt to fix any bugs that occured due to switching to React and split each component into their own file.
