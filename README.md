## Summary
I chose to change my A3 client side display using React.js. However, I didn't start with a new React project but instead I used in-browser Babel transformer. It's more expensive but it should work just fine with the scale of my project. But one thing do need to be pointed out: You can easily see a quick flickering of the user table every time after updating or reloading the page. This is the side product of "brutally" using Babel as a script tag.

## QA
Question: Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?   

Answer: React is very powerful and interesting tool. I enjoyed learning it as well as using it. However, I think it's more suitable for larger scale project where components can be reused frequently.
