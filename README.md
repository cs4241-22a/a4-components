## Movielist (v3)

your hosting link e.g. https://a4-edwardclifford.herokuapp.com/

This is the final iteration of the movie watchlist. I changed the UI to focus on the imagery associated with the movies instead of the text. The main focus is now the posters. Also, the search functionality uses half the screen and the watch list uses the other half. Using react made it easier to layout the site, and also improved the experience if rendering custom blocks of HTML. Preserving state was helpful for handling logging in and for getting information about the movies currently on screen. 10/10  react experience :)
