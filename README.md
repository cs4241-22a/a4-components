I used my second assignment code as a base for this project. It was much easier to develop since I used react before. I used same styling components and put them into js files. It was challenging for me to use the build files, since glitch didn't like the name of the folder. That is why I put all files from build folder to main directory of the application. All JS files are still in the src folder.
