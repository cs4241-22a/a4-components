Per instruction from this assignment, it's my first and last name in the title. I will warn you that my github username is also a website, but it's just the hello React template.


I was on the verge of getting this to work, but can't quite get it to update the inputs. This is somewhat of a improvement over earlier when it was just showing up as "undefined".

Anyway I'm shaking from exhaustion so I'm calling it a night. I could definitely make it work if it was just storing one string of a whole date, but I wanted to try and get the year calculation from the initial A2 working agian. 
As I write this it occurs to me I might be able to do both but because I did not start this as early as I should have, now is not going to be the time I do that. Maybe later.
