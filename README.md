Implemented a mix of A2 and A3 using React (kept the CSS styling from A3 because it was a lot cleaner than A2's, but kept the array "database" from A2 so I wouldn't have to worry about mongodb also).

For the most part, React helped improve the experience. It was a lot less .setattribute-ing (which caused issues in A3 that I did not have enough time to fix). Felt a lot more like writing some HTML within the App.jsx instead of having to dig around for methods that would achieve the same effect.
