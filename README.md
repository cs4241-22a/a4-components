I implemented A2 using React. The main thing I changed was switching from using flex display to grid for the grocery list display. In A2, I created each column as its own list, so I used flex display. But with React, I had an item component for each row, so I changed the list to display with grid formatting. I think it was easier to implement A2 with React because it made sense to have an Item component for each row. I had hardly any bugs related to React itself while working on this project.
