## To Do List Generator
My web application is a to do list generator that lets users input a task, a creation date, and whether or not the task is a priority. After submitting, users can view all of their to dos in a table. A derived field called "due date" is created based on the priority field inputted by the user. Contrary to Assignment #2, this assignment utilized React for development. Instead of having all data elements together, I created two separate components: one for the App itself and another for to dos. Ultimately, I found this technology to improve the development experience. React was a bit confusing at first because it combines JavaScript with HTML, but once I got the hang of it, I found it to be quite simple and time efficient. I also found that utilizing a state variable within React is much easier at keeping track of data rather than utilizing a global variable in a standard JavaScript file. Using React made the development experience much better, and I found it to be extremely useful in making the code more readable.
