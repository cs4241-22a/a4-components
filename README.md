## Title: Class Data Manager

I based this project off of Assignment 2. Because I didn't really 
understand assignment 2 and did not do a great job, I recreated assignment
2 based off assignment 3 and used that as a starting point for this project.
I also used the glitch react starting code for this project. 

The new technology hindered development because things like hooks were very
tricky to implement. I also had a difficult time figuring out where to start
for this project. However, with use of libraries and more experience
using React, I imagine it would be easier in the future.
