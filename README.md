Include a very brief summary of your project here 
and what you changed / added to assignment #3. 
Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: 
did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

In a4, I implemented React to my a2/a3 project of WPI Food Rating. The project is
similar, but has slight changes. Firstly, there is no drop down menu for food choice.
Instead, the user can enter whatever choice they want. There is also no restriction
for graduation year. Finally, there is a delete all button, which clears the table.

The new technology in the long term would have made the development of this website
much easier, had I turned this into a real website. As it is now, it didn't have
too much of an impact on the development experience. However, it feels as though using
React and jsx files would in general be easier for bigger projects.
