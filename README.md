Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #2. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
- I used react to change the way the website sent and recieved information from the server. The input fields are programmed reactively, along with the information display. With Express and react, the code for the client and server were both much more consise
and streamlined. However, it was much more difficult to set up due to the requirement of snowpack to continually build the project. All in all, I think that for smaller deployments such as this, it is less beneficial to use React, due to size and complexity overheads
