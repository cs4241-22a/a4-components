## Trip Planner made with React

http://a4-benjamin-gilchrist.glitch.me

this assignment was to completely redo assignment 2 with react.
added react greatly sped up development, including complicated features such as modify.
this was able to be quickly added due to the reactivity and reusability of various methods. 
the majority of htis assignment was written in jsx to be compiled with react and snowpack.
modify button was added to assignment 2 as an additional feature.
