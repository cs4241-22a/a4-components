## Name-a-Rat

http://a4-charles-snow.glitch.me

I based this project off of a2. It's almost entirely the same, however I changed it to only use a rat name, as I thought that it improved the application. I think react is a useful tool, however on an app with this small of a scale I felt that setting up react takes significantly more work than not using it, and it hindered the development experience.
