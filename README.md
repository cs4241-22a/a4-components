## A4 - Secure Todo List w/ React!

heroku link: https://boiling-cliffs-41208.herokuapp.com/

Login and create a Todo list. Todo page is now written with react components, using stuff like the map function, props, useState & useEffect hooks. There are 3 main components, an addTodo form, editTodo form, and the ListTodo table that dynamically renders with react based on data from Mongo. Before, I was also doing client side rendering by manually typing a lot of html and adding/removing a css class with "display: none;" to get things to render and hide. React made rendering certain things much easier, especially with jsx.
