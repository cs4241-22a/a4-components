This project is built off of the last assignment.

It is a todo list made with react and express. I used component classes for everything which proved to be difficult because most of the documentation is functionally based.
THis technology definitely  hindered my ability to complete this project. There were way too many 'special' react things I discovered  through hours of smashing my head on the keyboard  and googling all night. We'll see if I continue to use react for the final project
