## TV Show Tracker -- in React

https://a4-grace-yue.glitch.me/

Redesigned the user interface from A2 using class-based components in React. The new technology definitely improved the development experience, at least once I figured out how to use Snowpack. Managing the flow of data through components was a lot easier than having the server fire back with HTML markdown that just got plopped right into the webpage. React was practically designed for making single-page apps, which is what my A2 was, so it was quite a natural fit here.
