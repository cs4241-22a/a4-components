I was given an extension from the professor. 

## Jackie's Art Museum Using React

Glitch https://a4-jlopez-codes.glitch.me 

I based off this assignment from A2 by implementing React. The easiest way for me to do it was using Glitch's already-made react template. I believe it was so much easier using react and it felt like I had to use a lot less code. Everything should work.
