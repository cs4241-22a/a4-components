The project is a continuation of a simple To DO list app from project 2 adapted to use React and Bootstrap. 

Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
React had a pretty steep learning curve to it (like most new libraries). It took quite a while to get the basics working. Additionally, debugging front-end code is always a pain. 
However, the increased access to logical operations and more advanced structures was fantastic! Given several more weeks of practice, using React would be a great experience for front end compared to plain HTML or Handlebars
