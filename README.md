## A2 Redesign and React-implementation

https://a4-quinguyen-dev.glitch.me/

For A4, I decided to redo A2 with React. Instead of my older UI, I decided to use the UI from my A3 since it is more professionally made. The backend is similar to what it was in A2 but I decided to implement some middleware with it. React made it much easier to display the data because of the mounting abilities. I used Bootstrap as my CSS framework to make my life easier with styling.
