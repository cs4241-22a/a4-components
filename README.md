## Instant Data Cruncher
This simple web tool allows users to find various measures of average of a group of numbers. Type a number of at most 10 digits into the text field, press enter or the "Add to List" button. The number will be added to the list below and the measures of average will be calculated automatically. To delete an entry in the list, click on the number.

This page uses CSS Flexbox and now uses React to dynamically display the measures of average and the number list!

The measures of average are derived server-side from the input data.
