Ergometer Workout Log

http://a4-ryjdillon.glitch.me/

This app is a logbook designed to keep track of ergometer workouts, including the date,
total time rowed, and total meters rowed.

For this assignment, I redid the client portion of my A2 with React. I thought
that using the new technology, while it was a learning curve at first, ultimately
made my code easier to understand and more streamlined. As I went along,
writing the code became simpler as well, as I understood more how to
use the new technology.

I would also like to apologize in advance for this being several hours late past the due time :)
