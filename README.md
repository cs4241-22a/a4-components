Assignment 4 - Components

Assignment 4 was a more effective version of the original "Name this Alfie" web board from A2.

# The Alfie Nicknaming Site 
### A Lesson in Scaling & Design Compatability

I chose to revisit the original requirements from a2 to re-think my approach to a funny cat nicknaming page by using react and its libraries to create much more straightforward design and implementation. The experience gained from my struggle to properly implement my idea in a2 and complications despite strides made during a3 led me to re-design the Alfie board to focus on one funny image, with responses that could be more easily viewed, added, or removed. I found the abundant documentation surrounding React to be highly useful, and I was more easily able to add save and delete buttons in combination with JS functions to make new notes contained in divs appear and disappear. I found that React also made styling the page relatively fast and easy thanks to the pre-segmented nature of the header and app JS files allowing for intuitive object spacing with a few CSS additions mainly for color themeing. A brief example of how my previous and newly imrpvoed design differ is included below!
## Previous Design

While the page above maintains a similar color scheme, it is busy and potentially overcomplicates the baseline objectives of a2 & a3 by having there be a variety of images with different potential names. This more cluttered display and longer list of images leads to a multi-page format, making it more difficult for users to see their funny answers, obscuring my original purpose. 

## Improved Design

The improved design is more simplisitic and clean in its design, with an easy to view and use image board that allows users to add and delete funny answers without a hassle, completing the objectives of a2 without obfuscation. 

Overall, using React improved my design experience and I would gravitate toward doing so again!
