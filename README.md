## Name This Rat
This great app allows you to name a rat! I used a CSS flexbox to position the data. I ran out of time so unfortunately I tried but couldn't get it to delete. No additional instruction required to use the application.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single-page app that shows the current rat data upon submitting on the same page.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I interviewed Owen Pfannenstiehl. He said that my app UI was simple, readable, and intuitive. He thought that there were no issues and had no trouble. He named the rat Carter. He didn't like the solid white background and that everything was left justified. The left justified comment surprised me because I like that. I would change it to make the site more visually interesting.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I also interviewed Natalie McClain. She thought it was a solid website but wanted the ability to modify existing entries. Cute rat, fun names, 9/10. She named the rat sweaty. I was surprised by the comment to modify existing entries. I would change it to add this feature.
