### Summary
A small to-do list that fetches data from a server and displays it on-screen using React. The project is basically identical to my A2 submission in function, but now uses the Snowpack bundler and React to display changes in data. This required some stripping tables from my HTML file and using the app div to insert items into a table rendered through React.

### Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
I'd say that, at least for a project this small, the new tech was more of a hindrance than anything. While I could see React being useful for when you want to keep track of many changing elements on a page without much hassle, such as in the example, for something as simple as this is was somewhat overcomplicated. For a table of data, I had to do much more setup to achieve the same things, such as making the table update. Snowpack also made compiling on Glitch take quite a while.
