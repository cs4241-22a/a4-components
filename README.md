The Assignment tracker application allows you to add and delete assignments. You may add the assignment name, subject, and deadline. The app will assign a priority based on if the assignment is your MQP and if it is CS. This is my assignment 2 modified with REACT, it also received a fuctional and visual overhaul to make this assignment easier and more presentable with my new knowledge. 

Did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

The new technology definitely helped my development experience overall. There was a little learning curve with react that I definitely had to lookup and read/watch some tutorials to understand how it worked. When I originally did assignment #2 I struggled with making and updating a table, react made this a lot easier to implement. At first having your HTML and JavaScript in the same file was hard but in the end it made it easier to edit. The code was also in general easier to edit because of this.
