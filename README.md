Assignment 4 - Components
===

timer.axpdsp.org

I modified assignment three with react. I had already created assignment three
using react components, which made managing state very convienient, especially
in managing the accelerometer. In addition, I have made other unrelated
improvements to assignment three. The server now converts usernames to lower
case, so case variations are accepted when logging in. Passwords are hashed in a
secure mannner. Finally, various small changes to the user interface have been
made to improve the user experience when using the accelerometer.
