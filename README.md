## Grocery List Tracker (With React)

React made the client-side much easier to create. I didn't have to manually search through DOM elements by id to get information, instead it was all maintainted in variables with useState. This made it much easier to update the information on the server. It also made it easier to update DOM elements with the correct data with useEffect.
