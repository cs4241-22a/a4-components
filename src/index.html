                Have you ever gotten lost in the sprawling bike paths of Institute Park? Trying to get home before dinner but
                still want to get in a quick afterschool trip up to the top of Mount Washington? If this sounds like you, you
                probably won't have the foresight to use something like this. But don't let me be the one to stop you.

            Planning your upcoming hike is about as fast as you get ready after sleeping through your alarm on exam day.

                If a past trip is already in the server's database, it will already be visible in the table. From here, you can
                either fill in the specified fields and press "submit" to add a trail to your planned trip, or press "CLEAR DATA" to
                start fresh with a new trip.

                Your trip will be saved by the server until you clear it, meaning family members, friends, or that weird neighbour
                you have that is always peeking through the curtains can see <em>exactly</em> where you will be during your trip.
